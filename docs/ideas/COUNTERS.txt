# Counters

A simple way to keep track of counters for `groups` and `logs-count` would be:

- attach a trigger to the fetchq'a document table in insert/delete that append
  a variation (+1-1) to a counters WAL table
- having a generic maintenance table that processes the WAL tables and computes
  the counters values

The same principle can be applied to the logs/insert&delete so to be able to apply
some form of log limitation. By keeping tracks of how many logs each group has
generated, we can create a maintenance queue that drops old logs based on group limits.
